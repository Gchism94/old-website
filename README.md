I develop statistics and reproducible research curriculum as a Computational and Data Science Educator at the University of Arizona Data Science Institute, where my experience with image and video analysis and research ethics support my devotion to open science. My Ph.D. dissertation, under the guidance of Dr. Anna Dornhaus, focused on how the shapes of ant nests affect how they behave, and addressed links between animal and human architectures. I am actively involved in R programming consultation and workshops, statistical training, and collaborative, reproducible research.
