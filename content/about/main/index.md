  Stories are practically built into our DNA; we've been writing them for over 3,000 years. As a research scientist transitioning into a data scientist I have learned how valuable data is in telling stories. My passion is to leverage my six+ years of experience to help others tell their stories or gain new insights.

  Following my doctoral training, I have honed my data science toolkit to contain inferential statistics, machine learning, containers, and programming so that I can best address any project or challenge. 

Over the past six+ years, I have:
- Managed interdisciplinary and collaborative research projects resulting in reproducible, open source containers (GitHub actions & Binder, Docker & CyVerse), publications, and presentations at multiple conferences towards broad audiences.

- Developed websites, dashboards, and documentation (RMarkdown/Quarto) that leverages statistics and high-quality visualizations.

- Managed data science learning cohorts towards open, reproducible science and collaboration within and across their domains.
