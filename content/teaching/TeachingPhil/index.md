Throughout my teaching tenure, I have discovered the uniqueness and diversity that students possess, not only in their backgrounds, interests, and aptitude to learn, but also their accessibility to materials, software, and professional connections. It is my desire to create a safe and open learning environment that engages and nurtures students and provides both free and inter-operable materials. I also believe in individual mentorship to provide every student with equal opportunity to succeed when navigating the professional world. Access to higher education does not guarantee equity amongst students, and underrepresented populations, such as those in Tucson, AZ, do not have access to the same opportunities as those more privileged. I believe that I can guide these students compassionately through universally accessible learning and by connecting them with professionals who have successfully undergone their journey.

I believe that there are five essential elements towards successfully teaching across diversity. (1) The teacher should utilize free and open source materials. (2) Teachers must use inter-operable methods that work for all students. (3) The teacher should make the student the hero by harnessing their perspectives, interests, and backgrounds. (4) The teacher must provide equal opportunity to for student success, including professional development. (5) The teacher must ensure that the hero (students) will leave their class with the confidence to apply what they learned to the real world.
