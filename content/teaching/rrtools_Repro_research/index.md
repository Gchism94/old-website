We are experiencing a reproducibility crisis in science, largely because we have yet to fully adopt widespread publishing of code and data.

The goal of a research compendium is to provide a standard and easily recognizable way for organizing the digital materials of a project to enable others to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research.

In this workshop series, I first use the R package `rrtools` to provide attendees with a straightforward way to produce a template research compendium with the RStudio IDE and GitHub. I then use the R packages `rtools` and `devtools` to teach attendees how to make their compendium conform to the R package structure. I finally use the `distill` package to show attendees how they can reproduce a research or technical paper in a readable HTML format.
